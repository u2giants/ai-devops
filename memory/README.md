# memory/ — cross-machine Claude auto-memory

This tree is the synced home for **Claude Code's auto-memory** so a fact written
on one machine reaches all the others. Populated and read by
[`../bin/ai-sync-memory`](../bin/ai-sync-memory); driven by the `sync-dotfiles`
skill. Part of config-consolidation Phase 1
([`../docs/config-consolidation-proposal.md`](../docs/config-consolidation-proposal.md)).

## Background: what "auto-memory" is

Claude Code keeps a per-project memory folder at
`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/` containing a `MEMORY.md` index plus one `.md`
file per fact. It's loaded into context each session so Claude recalls durable
project knowledge. Until this tree existed, that memory lived only on the machine
where it was written — a fact saved on t16 never reached 916.

## Layout

```
memory/
  <project>/            # canonical project key: dflow, oracle, ansible, 1password-mcp, ...
    MEMORY.md           # the per-project index (one line per fact file)
    *.md                # individual fact files (user/feedback/project/reference)
  project-map.tsv       # optional slug -> project overrides
  README.md             # this file
```

## Why canonical project keys (not raw slugs)

On each machine memory lives at `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`, where
`<slug>` encodes the **working-copy path** — e.g. `C--repos-dflow` on a box where
the repo is on `C:`, `D--repos-dflow` where it's on `D:`. Those are the **same
project**, so `ai-sync-memory` **canonicalizes** the slug to a single key.

**Default heuristic:** drop everything up to and including the last `repos-`.
- `C--repos-dflow` → `dflow`
- `D--repos-dflow` → `dflow`  (unifies with the above)
- `C--repos-oracle` → `oracle`
- `C--repos-ansible` → `ansible`

**Overrides** for cases the heuristic gets wrong go in `project-map.tsv`
(`slug<TAB>project`, `#` comments allowed). Current override:
```
C--repos-temp-1Password-MCP	1password-mcp
```
(without it the key would be `temp-1Password-MCP`, which wouldn't unify with a
`C--repos-1Password-MCP` checkout on another machine.)

## Usage

```bash
# preview (no writes):
bin/ai-sync-memory push --dry-run
bin/ai-sync-memory pull --dry-run

# real:
bin/ai-sync-memory push      # machine memory  -> this repo working tree
#   then review, git add memory/, commit, push
bin/ai-sync-memory pull      # repo memory     -> machine (only projects that already exist locally)
```

Or just say **"sync my dotfiles"** and the skill runs pull → install → push →
commit for you.

### push (machine → repo)
Copies every `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/` into `memory/<canonical>/`. Then
YOU review and commit (the script never commits, so you can inspect first).

### pull (repo → machine)
For each `memory/<project>/`, finds local project dir(s) whose slug canonicalizes
to `<project>` and copies the files in. **Projects that don't exist locally yet
are skipped** — there's no local path to write into until you've opened that repo
on this machine once (Claude creates the `projects/<slug>/` dir then). Re-run
pull after that.

## Onboarding scenarios

- **New machine:** clone ai-devops, run the installer, then `ai-sync-memory pull`.
  Only projects you've already opened locally receive memory; open the others once
  and pull again.
- **New project:** just use it — the next `push` picks up its memory folder and
  creates `memory/<project>/` automatically. Add a `project-map.tsv` line only if
  the canonical key comes out wrong.
- **Same project on a different drive:** the canonicalization handles `C:` vs `D:`
  automatically; no action needed.

## Conflict resolution

Two machines editing the same fact file, both pushing, is an **ordinary git merge
conflict** in a `.md` file — resolve it like any doc (keep both facts, or the
newer one). Because memory is plain Markdown, conflicts are human-readable. To
minimize them, `pull` before a work session and `push`+commit at the end (the
`sync-dotfiles` skill does both).

## Rules

- **Secret-free — hard rule.** Memory holds facts, not credentials. This tree is
  committed to git. If a memory file ever contains a token/key/password, STOP:
  remove it, and put the secret in 1Password (`vibe_coding` vault) instead. Never
  commit it here.
- Don't hand-edit another machine's memory blindly; prefer pulling, editing on the
  owning project, and pushing.
- `MEMORY.md` inside each project is an index only — keep it one line per fact
  file (this mirrors how Claude Code maintains it locally).
