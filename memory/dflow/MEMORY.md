# Memory Index

- [Project: Designflow PLM — repo layout & rules](project_designflow.md) — 6 repos cloned to D:\repos\, sandbox-albert branch only, never merge
- [User: Albert — role & preferences](user_albert.md) — repo owner, works on sandbox-albert branch
- [Feedback: AG Grid & coding rules](feedback_ag_grid_rules.md) — AG Grid MCP mandatory, no aggFunc, no deprecated APIs, unit tests required
- [Feedback: Login broken / "Microsoft sign-in failed" / "Session expired" → BFF OIDC backend URLs](feedback_bff_oidc.md) — recurring incident (3+ times). Whenever login breaks on sandbox, read this FIRST. BFF *_BACKEND_URL env vars and Cloud Build trigger substitutions must always be *.run.app service URLs, not custom domains (Cloud Run OIDC audience rule). Includes triage gcloud commands and fix.
- [Feedback: Always create GCP secrets immediately when adding --set-secrets to cloudbuild.yaml](feedback_secret_manager.md) — never leave Secret Manager setup as a manual step; run gcloud secrets create + versions add + IAM binding in the same session.
- [Feedback: Branch & PR flow](feedback_branch_pr_flow.md) — sync develop→sandbox-albert before new code, ship via PR sandbox-albert→develop (both repos); the "never merge" docs text is intentionally left conflicting per Albert.
- [Project: Sample tracking module](project_sample_tracking.md) — new 3rd tracking flavor (own thin tables + reused skin); links to itemHeader/ProdOrder for future licensing/production integration; built+committed on sandbox-albert (not pushed).
- [Project: designflow_dev GridLayout CP437 mojibake](project_designflow_dev_mojibake.md) — garbled Chinese sub-grid headers = data corrupt at rest in designflow_dev (manual Windows-console seed); clean source in designflow_sandbox; fixed + how to re-seed safely.
- [Project: Sandbox deploy + startup-test-gate 404 trap](project_sandbox_deploy.md) — alsand deploys are MANUAL (gcloud builds submit + run deploy --image); backend containers run `npm test &&` before the server, so a hanging/failing test fails the Cloud Run probe and pins traffic to the old revision → new routes 404. Triage + fix (jest --forceExit).
