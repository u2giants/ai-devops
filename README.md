# AI DevOps Toolkit

A backed-up, repeatable AI coding workflow toolkit. Scripts, prompt templates,
restore docs, and skill/MCP scaffolding for a multi-model staged coding workflow
built around **Claude (Opus 4.8)** and **Codex / GPT-5.5**.

This repo exists so the entire workflow can be **restored from zero** on a fresh
Ubuntu server if the current one dies.

---

## Where this lives

This system lives at:

```
/worksp/ai-devops
```

> Do **not** use `/opt/ai-devops`. Every script, symlink, and doc assumes
> `/worksp/ai-devops`.

Config lives outside the repo (so it is never committed):

```
/etc/ai-devops/models.env     # model command overrides
/etc/ai-devops/server.env     # server-specific settings
/var/log/ai-devops/           # logs
```

---

## What this repo does NOT store

This repo is safe to keep **private** on GitHub. It never stores:

- `.env` files or any real environment files (only `*.env.example`)
- API tokens, secrets, passwords
- `auth.json`, GitHub credentials, `gh` tokens
- SSH private keys (`id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, `*.pem`, `*.key`)
- `~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, or any login/session state
- Production credentials of any kind

The `.gitignore` actively blocks these patterns. Real config lives in
`/etc/ai-devops/` on each machine, never in git.

## The model workflow

| Stage | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| Plan / architecture | **Opus 4.8 (high reasoning)** | Implementation plans, architecture design |
| Plan review | **Opus** | Independent review of the plan |
| Implementation | **GPT-5.5 / Codex** | Writes the code, smallest safe change |
| Diff review | **Opus** | Reviews the git diff for regressions |
| Test | **GPT-5.5 / Codex** | Runs tests, visual checks, fixes, reruns |
| Security review | **Opus** | Auth, data-leak, SQL, secrets review |
| Final review | **Opus 4.8 (high reasoning)** | Final product/architecture sign-off |

High-level roles:

- **Opus 4.8 high reasoning** — implementation plans, architecture review, final
  product/architecture review.
- **GPT-5.5 / Codex** — coding, implementation, testing, fixing.
- **Opus** — independent review throughout: plan review, diff review, security
  review, final review.

The exact CLI flags for each model live in `/etc/ai-devops/models.env` and can be
edited per machine (see `docs/model-setup.md`).

## Fresh server install

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git
git clone https://github.com/u2giants/ai-devops.git /worksp/ai-devops
cd /worksp/ai-devops
./install.sh
gh auth login
claude login      # or: claude  (follow login prompt)
codex login       # or: codex   (follow login prompt)
ai-devops doctor
```

Full step-by-step: [`docs/restore-from-zero.md`](docs/restore-from-zero.md).

---

## Update process

```bash
cd /worksp/ai-devops
./update.sh
```

`update.sh` pulls the latest repo and re-runs `install.sh`. It never overwrites
`/etc/ai-devops/*.env`.

---

## Restore process

If the server dies, provision a new Ubuntu box and follow
[`docs/restore-from-zero.md`](docs/restore-from-zero.md). Everything needed is in
this repo; only the logins (gh / claude / codex) are re-done interactively.

---

## Basic commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `ai-devops doctor` | Health-check the toolkit and its dependencies |
| `ai-devops version` | Print the toolkit version |
| `ai-devops paths` | Print the paths this toolkit uses |
| `ai-workspace-status` | Show git/branch/PR safety status of the current repo |
| `ai-codex-review <mode>` | Read-only Codex second-opinion review |
| `ai-model-call <stage> <prompt> <out>` | Generic model invocation helper |
| `ai-run-task "<task>"` | Scaffold a new staged task run (v0.1) |

`ai-codex-review` modes: `plan-review`, `diff-review`, `security-review`,
`visual-review`, `final-check`.

## Repo layout

```
bin/            Executable CLI tools (symlinked into /usr/local/bin by install.sh)
config/         *.env.example templates (copied to /etc/ai-devops on install)
templates/      Prompt templates and per-repo doc add-ons
docs/           Restore, setup, onboarding, and future-feature docs
skills/         Claude + Codex skill scaffolding
mcp/            Future MCP wrapper scaffolding
install.sh      Install/verify deps, config, symlinks; runs doctor
update.sh       Pull + re-install (keeps existing config)
uninstall.sh    Remove symlinks (keeps config/auth unless flagged)
```

## Safety notes

- Review scripts (`ai-codex-review`) are **read-only** by default — they never
  commit, push, merge, or delete.
- `ai-run-task` is v0.1 scaffolding — it does not edit code.
- Application repos are **not** touched by this toolkit's setup.
