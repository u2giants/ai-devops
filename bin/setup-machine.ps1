<#
setup-machine.ps1 — one-script new-machine setup for a Windows coding computer.

Run in PowerShell 7 (pwsh) — NOT Windows PowerShell 5.1:
  pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\bin\setup-machine.ps1

  `powershell` is 5.1 and this script throws on it (see the version guard below).
  Install pwsh with: winget install Microsoft.PowerShell

NOT fully unattended: step 3 prompts once with Read-Host for the 1Password
service-account token, unless -Token is passed or the token file already exists
at %USERPROFILE%\.config\ai-devops\op-service-account. An automated/AI session
will BLOCK there.

What it does (idempotent — safe to re-run):
  1. Ensures git, the 1Password CLI (op), and (best-effort) Node/npx are present.
  2. Clones/updates the ai-devops repo and installs Claude + Codex skills and the
     global instruction files (delegates to install-ai-devops-windows.ps1).
  3. Stores the vault-locked 1Password SERVICE-ACCOUNT token ONCE in a
     user-only file  %USERPROFILE%\.config\ai-devops\op-service-account.
     (Not an environment variable: the Store/MSIX Claude Desktop sandbox does
     not inherit user env vars, and can strip env blocks from its config.)
  4. Installs the central reference file  ...\ai-devops\mcp.env  (op:// refs).
  5. Writes a launcher  ...\ai-devops\mcp-launch.cmd  that reads the token from
     the file and runs each MCP server under `op run --env-file mcp.env`, so
     secrets resolve at launch and NO secret is ever written into the config.
  6. Restores the 916-alien SSH key from 1Password to ~\.ssh\916-alien (+ .pub)
     and installs the managed SSH host aliases (~/.ssh/ai-devops.conf, Included
     from ~/.ssh/config), so `ssh vps` / `ssh vps2` / `ssh seafile` etc. work
     immediately. Uses cloudflared so it works on any network without Tailscale.
  7. Wires the FULL MCP server set into BOTH Claude Desktop's
     claude_desktop_config.json and Claude Code's ~/.claude/settings.json (each
     backed up first). The set is defined exactly once, in step 5d, and both
     surfaces merge it — so a server added there reaches every surface on every
     machine, and a fresh machine ends up matching an established one.
       - stdio via the op launcher : supabase (--read-only), trigger, 1password
       - remote via mcp-remote shim: devops-mcp, synology-monitor, recall-ai
       - no secret, plain npx      : playwright, ag-grid, vercel (browser OAuth)
       - codex-cli                 : native `codex mcp-server`, absolute exe
     No token is ever written into either config; only URLs and op:// references.
     Servers we do not define (the Windows-MCP extension, anything hand-added)
     and all other settings keys are preserved untouched.

IMPORTANT — Claude Desktop limitations you must know (verified):
  - Claude Desktop does NOT expand ${VAR} in its config, and neither does
    mcp-remote in --header. So tokens are resolved to real values by `op` at
    launch (inside a launcher .cmd), not by placeholder substitution.
  - MSIX sandbox does not inherit setx env vars and can strip `env` blocks, so
    the token is read from a file by the launcher, never set as a system var.
  - This script's Desktop-config step is BEST-EFFORT and could not be tested on
    Linux; after running, verify in Claude Desktop that all three MCPs show
    connected. A validation checklist is printed at the end.

Flags:
  -Token <ops_...>     Provide the token non-interactively (else you are asked).
  -SkipDesktopMcp      Do the token/env/skills wiring but do not touch the
                       Claude Desktop config.
  -RepoPath <path>     Where ai-devops lives (default: $HOME\repos\ai-devops).

# 6b. Codex on PATH — make `codex exec` actually able to write
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The standalone installer puts …\Programs\OpenAI\Codex\bin on PATH, but that dir
# is a JUNCTION to the package's bin\ and its parent has no codex-resources\
# sibling. Codex resolves its sandbox helper at <exe_dir>\..\codex-resources\, so
# via that PATH entry every sandboxed write fails with "program not found" — while
# `codex --version` and `codex login status` still succeed. That combination
# (healthy-looking, silently non-functional) cost a full debugging session on
# 2026-07-16. Fix: put the real package bin FIRST on the user PATH. `current` is a
# junction the updater re-points, so this survives Codex upgrades.
