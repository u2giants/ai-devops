#!/usr/bin/env bash
# setup-secrets.sh — wire up automatic, vault-locked secret resolution for
# Claude Code on this Ubuntu machine. Idempotent; safe to re-run.
#
# What it does (nothing here is a secret except the one token you paste once):
#   1. Verifies the `op` (1Password) CLI is installed.
#   2. Stores the vault-locked 1Password SERVICE-ACCOUNT token ONCE, locked
#      down at ~/.config/ai-devops/op-service-account (chmod 600). This token
#      can only ever read the `vibe_coding` vault — nothing else.
#   3. Installs the central reference file  ~/.config/ai-devops/mcp.env  from
#      this repo's config/mcp.env.example (op:// references, never values).
#   4. Installs a managed shell snippet ~/.config/ai-devops/shellrc that:
#        - exports OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN from the locked-down file, and
#        - resolves all op:// references in one `op run` invocation (never
#          overwriting a value that is already set).
#      and makes ~/.bashrc and ~/.profile source it (one include line).
#      There is NO `claude` launcher/wrapper: every CLI in the session (claude,
#      supabase, scripts, ...) is authorized by the exported environment, so
#      nothing shadows or re-invokes `claude`. (This header previously described
#      an `op run --env-file ... -- claude` launcher; that was never what the code
#      does, and the stale text caused a real misdiagnosis on 2026-07-16 — the
#      launcher was reasoned about as a rollout risk that does not exist.)
#      Cost to know: one shared refresh runs per interactive shell start, and the
#      resolved secrets live in that shell's environment.
#   5. Installs two MCP launchers (~/.config/ai-devops/mcp-launch.sh and
#      mcp-remote-launch.sh) so each MCP server resolves its own secrets at
#      launch, independent of whether the session sourced .bashrc.
#   6. Merges the FULL MCP server set into ~/.claude/settings.json — the same set
#      bin/setup-machine.ps1 installs on Windows, so every machine and both
#      surfaces agree. Only our own mcpServers keys are touched; permissions,
#      hooks, plugins and any other server are preserved untouched.
#   7. Comments out any legacy RAW `export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=ops_...`
#      lines and old per-app op-read blocks left in ~/.bashrc (with a backup),
#      so the only copy of the token on disk is the locked-down file.
#   8. Verifies every reference resolves (prints PASS/FAIL, never a value).
#
# Usage:
#   setup-secrets.sh                 # set up / refresh
#   setup-secrets.sh --dry-run       # show what would change, do nothing
#   setup-secrets.sh --no-legacy     # skip the ~/.bashrc legacy cleanup
#   OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=ops_... setup-secrets.sh   # non-interactive token
#
# The token can only be scoped to one vault; there is no way for it to read any
# other 1Password vault or login. That is the whole point.
